# ReadKeyboard

ReadKeyboard is an application that records and stores keystroke events made by the user on the keyboard.

You can use the batch file to simplify the process of compiling and executing Java code through a script.

Important! 
- verify the location where the keystrokes are being saved
    public Path fileName = Path.of("**E:\\files.txt**");
